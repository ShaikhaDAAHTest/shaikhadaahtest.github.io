## My Digital Literacy Narrative with the Help of ChatGPT

Title: Navigating the Digital Wilderness: My Journey into Digital Humanities

As a 21-year-old university student, I embarked on a new academic adventure this semester: an introductory course in Digital Humanities. Little did I know that it would transform the way I perceive, interact with, and create content in the digital realm. This narrative explores my evolving digital literacy journey, the strategies I employ in my daily and academic life, and my aspirations for what lies ahead.

Before enrolling in this course, my digital literacy skills were primarily centered around some basics along with some skills and knowledge from a digital humanities course I took in fall of 2022 called 'Digital Archives'. In this course, I learned how to use tools such as Voyant, Antconc, and use platforms such as google sites and Omeka for coursework relating to the exploration, creation, and analysis of digital archives. These skills, along with weekly readings on the history, application, and ethics of online archives helped form the baseline of my knowledge pertaining to digital humanities. Exploring online archives and databases such as the internet archive, the wayback machine, and different crowdsourcing foundations opened up my field of view to what’s out there in terms of robust data. Terminology relating to textual analysis such as OCR and HTR are familiar to me and I can loosely adapt them to new material if needed. One tool that I still regularly use in my academic practices is Zotero. Zotero has transformed the way that I create, store, and organize my references and bibliographies, and I regularly use it for my classes and capstone research.

Aside from what I learned in that course, I know how to use social media platforms, compose emails, and write research papers using Microsoft Word. My content creation process revolved around the simple tools available on my smartphone, and also design tools such as canva and procreate. Socially, I interacted with friends and classmates on Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok, but I never delved into the deeper aspects of online communities or digital communication. In my daily life, I heavily rely on Google Drive for document storage, creation, and collaboration, and use Google Calendar for scheduling. 

Frankly, even given my knowledge from the Digital Archives course, I still had much to learn in terms of data analysis and applications to text, image, and geo-mapping. Enrolling in the Digital Humanities course was a pivotal moment. The course exposed me to a plethora of digital tools and concepts that have broadened my horizons. 

In the first 2 weeks, I learned about the different content management systems like WordPress, notion, and GitHub, which opened up new avenues for blogging and website creation. Given that I was already comfortable using google sites, exploring other systems gave me a point of comparison and allowed me to step outside of my comfort zone. I was also already familiar with Github from my previous Interactive Media (IM) courses, and used the markdown language frequently for my README.md files to document my IM projects and collaborate with others on coding projects. However, closing repositories and using templates for websites was a new concept to me and allowed me to learn a quick, efficient way to create a website that was easy to navigate, edit, and publish for free.

However, the true eye-opener was when we delved into research data management and analysis. We explored data analysis and manipulation using R on Posit.cloud, which would also allow us to create visualizations and summaries, illuminating the power of data-driven insights. For the first assignment, we learned about APIs, and used the Harvard Museum API to analyze cultural data from the plethora of artworks. We were able to quickly modify the code to analyze our cultures of interest, and the API provided a plethora of information on the specific items. We also used Posit.cloud to compare the frequency of words across three books. This allowed me to grow more comfortable with using and recognizing R language code, and made me realized its breadth of possible applications in the field of digital humanities.

In the recent weeks, we’ve been delving into more visual forms of analysis with geo-mapping and image analysis with Orange data mining and Kepler. We also used Chatgpt to optimize the process of sorting data into tables and csv files to be managed more efficiently. I was really drawn to image analysis as it was fascinating trying to make sense of the software and how it bifurcates the images, sorts them into a grid, and groups similar images together. At times it goes beyond just color or contrast, and seems to recognize people, even in groups, and buildings or forms of transportation. This experience prompted me to think more critically of what ai and image sorting software are capable of, and which image collections can be scrutinized through them.

My current abilities have grown significantly, but I am keenly aware of how much more there is to learn. The course has ignited a passion for digital humanities, pushing me to seek further knowledge independently. I now understand that digital literacy is not a static skill but a constantly evolving journey. I aspire to become proficient in data analysis, mastering statistical techniques and data visualization tools to unlock the potential of big data in humanities research.

Furthermore, I am intrigued by the ethical implications of digital humanities. As we navigate the digital landscape, questions about data privacy, biases in algorithms, and the accessibility of digital content are more relevant than ever. I hope to explore these issues deeply and contribute to discussions on responsible and equitable digital practices.

In conclusion, my journey into digital humanities has been a transformative experience. From a basic to intermediate digital literacy background, I have ventured into the realms of content creation, social interaction, and research data management and analysis. While my current abilities have grown, I am acutely aware of the vast expanse of knowledge yet to be explored. My aspirations include mastering data analysis, understanding the ethical complexities of the digital world, and continuing to adapt and evolve as a digital citizen. This course has opened my eyes to the possibilities and responsibilities that come with digital literacy, and I am excited to continue my journey in this ever-evolving digital wilderness.
