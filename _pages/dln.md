## My Digital Literacy Narrative with the Help of ChatGPT

Title: Navigating the Digital Wilderness: My Journey into Digital Humanities

As a 21-year-old university student, I embarked on a new academic adventure this semester: an introductory course in Digital Humanities. Little did I know that it would transform the way I perceive, interact with, and create content in the digital realm. This narrative explores my evolving digital literacy journey, the strategies I employ in my daily and academic life, and my aspirations for what lies ahead.

Before enrolling in this course, my digital literacy skills were primarily centered around some basics along with some skills and knowledge from a digital humanities course I took in fall of 2022 called 'Digital Archives'. In this course, I learned how to use tools such as Voyant, Antconc, and use platforms such as google sites and Omeka for coursework relating to the exploration, creation, and analysis of digital archives. These skills, along with weekly readings on the history, application, and ethics of online archives helped form the baseline of my knowledge pertaining to digital humanities. Exploring online archives and databases such as the internet archive, the wayback machine, and different crowdsourcing foundations opened up my field of view to whatâ€™s out there in terms of robust data. Terminology relating to textual analysis such as OCR and HTR are familiar to me and I can loosely adapt them to new material if needed. One tool that I still regularly use in my academic practices is Zotero. Zotero has transformed the way that I create, store, and organize my references and bibliographies, and I regularly use it for my classes and capstone research.

Aside from what I learned in that course, I know how to use social media platforms, compose emails, and write research papers using Microsoft Word. My content creation process revolved around the simple tools available on my smartphone, and also design tools such as canva and procreate. Socially, I interacted with friends and classmates on Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok, but I never delved into the deeper aspects of online communities or digital communication. In my daily life, I heavily rely on Google Drive for document storage, creation, and collaboration, and use Google Calendar for scheduling. Frankly, even given my knowledge from the Digital Archives course, I still had much to learn in terms of data analysis and applications to text, image, and geo-mapping. 

Enrolling in the Digital Humanities course was a pivotal moment. The course exposed me to a plethora of digital tools and concepts that have broadened my horizons. I learned about content management systems like WordPress, which opened up new avenues for blogging and website creation. Markdown language became my go-to for formatting text, and platforms like GitHub allowed me to collaborate with others on coding projects.

Social interaction, too, took on a new dimension as I explored platforms like Slack, Discord, and Reddit, which facilitated discussions and collaboration in ways I had never experienced before. I began to see how online communities formed around shared interests, and I realized the potential for networking and learning from experts in various fields.

However, the true eye-opener was when we delved into research data management and analysis. We explored data manipulation with Python and data visualization with tools like Tableau, illuminating the power of data-driven insights.

My current abilities have grown significantly, but I am keenly aware of how much more there is to learn. The course has ignited a passion for digital humanities, pushing me to seek further knowledge independently. I now understand that digital literacy is not a static skill but a constantly evolving journey. I aspire to become proficient in data analysis, mastering statistical techniques and data visualization tools to unlock the potential of big data in humanities research.

Furthermore, I am intrigued by the ethical implications of digital humanities. As we navigate the digital landscape, questions about data privacy, biases in algorithms, and the accessibility of digital content are more relevant than ever. I hope to explore these issues deeply and contribute to discussions on responsible and equitable digital practices.

In conclusion, my journey into digital humanities has been a transformative experience. From a basic to intermediate digital literacy background, I have ventured into the realms of content creation, social interaction, and research data management and analysis. While my current abilities have grown, I am acutely aware of the vast expanse of knowledge yet to be explored. My aspirations include mastering data analysis, understanding the ethical complexities of the digital world, and continuing to adapt and evolve as a digital citizen. This course has opened my eyes to the possibilities and responsibilities that come with digital literacy, and I am excited to continue my journey in this ever-evolving digital wilderness.
